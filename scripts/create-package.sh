# Builds this package and produces a versioned .tgz - the exact file `npm publish` uploads - named from the version
# in package.json: automation-referenced-automation-api-<version>.tgz
#
# Two ways to use it:
#   1. Publish it to the registry:  ./scripts/publish-package.sh
#      Other repos then get it BY VERSION from their package.json (README: Publishing a package).
#   2. Keep it local: put the .tgz where the consuming repo can see it and install it there with
#      `npm install --no-save <file>.tgz` (README: Using a package without a registry) - or run
#      ./scripts/setup.sh --local in the consumer, which builds and installs every @automation dependency this way.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/create-package.sh [--local] [output-dir]
#   --local     build against the sibling @automation packages in ../shared-packages instead of the registry
#   output-dir  default ../shared-packages (sibling to this repo)
